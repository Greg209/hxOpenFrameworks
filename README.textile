h1. hxOpenFrameworks

"haXe":http://haxe.org/ binding of "OpenFrameworks":http://www.openframeworks.cc/.

h2. Why?

See my blog post "haXe for interactivity/creative coding":http://blog.onthewings.net/2010/05/06/haxe-for-interactivitycreative-coding/.

h2. Usage

Please refer to the examples under "of/examples":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/tree/master/of/examples.

Refer to "compile.hxml":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/blob/master/compile.hxml and "compile-mac.hxml":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/blob/master/compile-mac.hxml for compilation.

For API documentation please refer to the "original one":http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation?adv=yes.

__of__ prefix is removed except @ofLog@(there is @log@ for math).

I have replaced the event system with "HSL":http://code.google.com/p/hxhsl/. Now you can do @events.mouseMoved.bind(function(evt:MouseEventArgs){/*...*/});@.

@SoundStream@ requires "hxRtAudio":http://github.com/andyli/hxRtAudio and compiling with *-DHXCPP_MULTI_THREADED*.

Currently it supports C++ target on Windows, Mac, Linux (all 32bit only).

h2. Known issues

* @ofSerial@ and @ofArduino@ are not yet wrapped. If you need it, tell me or use "hxSerial":http://github.com/andyli/hxSerial.

h2. How to compiling ndll(not required for normal user)

* Clone this git repo by @git clone git://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks.git@
* @cd /path/to/hxOpenFrameworks@
* @git submodule init@
* @git submodule update@. It will clone the "openFramework fork":http://github.com/andyli/openFrameworks to _project/openFrameworks_.
* @cd project@ and compile the ndll by @haxelib run hxcpp build.xml@.

Linux ndll need *libopenFrameworks.a*, which can be compiled by:

* @cd project/openFrameworks/libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project/linux@
* @make@
