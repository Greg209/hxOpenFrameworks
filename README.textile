h1. hxOpenFrameworks

"haXe":http://haxe.org/ binding of "OpenFrameworks":http://www.openframeworks.cc/.

h2. Why?

See my blog post "haXe for interactivity/creative coding":http://blog.onthewings.net/2010/05/06/haxe-for-interactivitycreative-coding/.

h2. Usage

Please refer to the examples under "of/examples":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/tree/master/of/examples.

Refer to "compile.hxml":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/blob/master/compile.hxml and "compile-mac.hxml":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/blob/master/compile-mac.hxml for compilation.

Note that on Windows you need to copy ".hxcpp_config.xml":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/blob/master/.hxcpp_config.xml to ==%USERPROFILE%==.

For API documentation please refer to the "original one":http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation?adv=yes.

I have replaced the event system with "HSL":http://code.google.com/p/hxhsl/. However, you need the latest SVN version to workaround a hxcpp bug("see here":http://lists.motion-twin.com/pipermail/haxe/2010-September/038589.html). Simply get the SVN version of HSL and run @haxelib dev hsl-1 absolute/path/to/hxhsl/hsl source@ and @haxelib dev hsl-pico-1 absolute/path/to/hxhsl/hsl-pico source@.

Currently it supports Windows and Mac. Linux support will be added later.

Support C++ target only at this moment.

h2. Known issues

* @SoundStream@ is not working, the program crashes if you use it. If you're good at C++, please have a look and tell me why...
* @ofSerial@ and @ofArduino@ are not yet wrapped. If you need it, tell me or use "hxSerial":http://github.com/andyli/hxSerial.

h2. Changes to the OF source before compiling ndll(not required for normal user)

* Comment out @FMOD_System_Close@ in ofSoundPlayer.cpp
* Comment out the content of @ofSoundStreamClose@ in ofSoundStream.cpp
* Comment out @ExitMovies@ and @TerminateQTML@ in ofQtUtils.cpp
