h2. Usage

Please refer to the examples under "of/examples":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/tree/master/of/examples.

Refer to "compile.hxml":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/blob/master/compile.hxml and "compile-mac.hxml":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/blob/master/compile-mac.hxml for compilation.

Note that on windows you need to copy ".hxcpp_config.xml":http://github.com/andyli/hxOpenFrameworks/blob/master/.hxcpp_config.xml to %USERPROFILE%.

For API documentation please refer to the "original one":http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation?adv=yes.

It is under active development, only part of the API is wrapped. Please also expect some minor API cleanup in the future.

Currently it supports Windows and Mac. Linux support will be added later.

Support C++ target only at this moment.
